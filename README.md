# A Breif Overview of my Website
## Introduction
Hi This is Joshitha Nambakam.This is my personal website that I built to show my skills, projects, and experiences. It has five main pages, all designed to be easy to use and nice to look at.The Pages include the Home page (index.html).The about me page (about.html),skills page (skills.html),project page(projects.html),contact page (contact.html).

## Home Page 
This is the first page you see. It has my photo, a short introduction about me (a Computer Science student at Amrita University), and a button to download my resume. When you hover over things like my photo or buttons, they move a little to make the page feel interactive.


## About Page 
Here, I share more about myself, like my interests in technology and problem-solving. It also shows certificates I earned from college events, like a Quantum Computing workshop and a Soldering Contest. These certificates are displayed in neat boxes that lift up slightly when you hover over them.


## Skills Page 
This page lists what Iâ€™m good at, split into three groups:

Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Programming Languages (Java, Python)

Tools (GitHub, VS Code, Android Studio)
Each skill is in a small box that changes color when you hover over it.

## Projects Page 
Here, I showcase a shopping cart app I built using Java. You can:

Read about its features (like adding items and calculating discounts).

Download the app to try it yourself.

See a shopping cart icon that makes the page more visual.

## Contact Page 
If someone wants to reach me, they can fill out a simple form or click on my social media links (GitHub, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Email). The form works on phones and computers, and the social media icons grow a bit when you hover over them.

## Design & Features

Colors: Mostly purple and white, making it look clean and professional.

Fonts: Easy-to-read text with nice headings.

Mobile-Friendly: Works well on phones and tablets too.
